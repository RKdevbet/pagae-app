1. General Error Fixes

Identify and correct all existing errors across the application, including logic issues, UI bugs, broken flows, and unexpected behaviors.

Improve overall performance, stability, and consistency.

Ensure no feature requires manual page reloads to function correctly.

2. Monthly Closure System

Implement a monthly closing system with the following behavior:

All paid bills are automatically removed at the end of the month.

Monthly recurring bills are automatically renewed and reappear as pending in the new month.

Ensure the system correctly handles bill statuses during the month transition.

The process must be reliable and prevent duplicated or lost bills.

3. Settings Screen UI Fix (Light Mode)

Fix the opacity issue in the settings tab when using light mode.

Ensure background, texts, and components have proper contrast and visibility.

The settings screen must be fully readable and visually consistent with the rest of the app.

4. Real-Time Balance Update

Fix the balance update logic so the user’s balance is updated in real time.

Paying or editing a bill must immediately update the balance without requiring a page refresh.

Ensure the balance always reflects the current financial state accurately.

5. Language Fix – Home Menu

Fix the application’s home menu so it fully supports PT-BR.

Ensure all labels, buttons, titles, and dynamic texts in the home menu are properly translated.

Language changes must apply instantly and consistently.

6. User Nickname System

When creating an account or user profile, add an option to define a nickname.

The application must use this nickname to address and refer to the user throughout the interface.

Ensure the nickname can be edited later via settings.

7. Final Delivery

Deliver the application ready for real-world use, fully tested, stable, and polished.

Ensure all features work together seamlessly with no regressions.

The final result must be a user-friendly, scalable, and production-ready application
