Create a complete personal finance management application with the following requirements:

Core Financial System:

Implement a money balance system where the user registers their salary or available money.

Every time a bill is paid, the system must automatically subtract the paid amount from the user’s balance.

The balance must always reflect real-time updates after payments.

Bills and Payments:

Allow users to register bills with the following types:

Installment bills: bills that can be split into multiple payments, showing progress (e.g., 3/10 installments paid).

Monthly bills: recurring bills that automatically appear every month as pending payments.

Annual bills: recurring bills that automatically appear every year as pending payments.

Each bill must store due date, value, payment status, and recurrence type.

Progress and Tracking:

Installment bills must visually display payment progress.

Monthly and annual bills must be automatically regenerated when their period renews.

Notifications System:

Add notifications for:

Overdue bills

Bills successfully paid

Notifications must be configurable by the user.

Application Settings:

Create an in-app settings system where changes affect the entire application in real time.

Include the following options:

Enable/disable notifications

Light mode and dark mode (must visually change the app based on selection)

Language selection with full support for Brazilian Portuguese (PT-BR)

Currency conversion with full support for Brazilian Real (BRL)

Localization and Currency:

When PT-BR is selected, all texts must be translated accordingly.

When BRL is selected, all monetary values must be displayed in Brazilian Real format (R$).

User Experience:

The interface should be clean, intuitive, and easy to understand.

Ensure smooth user interaction and clear visual feedback for payments, balances, and notifications.

The final result should be a functional, scalable, and user-friendly financial management application.
